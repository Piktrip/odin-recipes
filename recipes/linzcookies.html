    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Linzer Eyes are probably one of the most famous and traditional Christmas biscuits in Austria.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>110 g / 3/4 cup icing sugar</li>
        <li>220 g / 1 cup butter</li>
        <li>310 g / 2 1/3 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>Lemon peel</li>
        <li>Apricot or redcurrant jam</li>
        <li>Icing sugar for sprinkling</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Cut the cold butter into small pieces and quickly crumble with the flour. Add sugar, egg, vanilla sugar, and grated lemon peel and mix into a smooth dough. Allow to cool or at least rest for half an hour.</li>
        <li>Then roll out the dough about 3 mm thick and cut out the slices with a serrated cutter. Cut holes into half of the slices (use a special cutter or small biscuit cutter). Place the slices on the baking tray and bake in a preheated oven at 200°C / 392°F for about 10 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>After baking, coat the bottoms with jam, place the tops, and sprinkle with icing sugar. Tip: Like all biscuits made from short pastry, Linzer Eyes require a storage time of approximately 14 days until they are tender. It is recommended to store them in sealed metal boxes.</li>
    </ol>
